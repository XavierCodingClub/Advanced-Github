### Output the list sorted with various algoritms ###

# To compare, output the unsorted list
print("Unsorted list:" + str(numList))

## Bubble sort ##

# Output sorted
foo = numList
print("Sorted with bubble sort" + str(algorithms.bubbleSort(foo)))

# Time the sorting with timeit.timeit
time = timeit.timeit('algorithms.bubbleSort(foo)',
                     'from __main__ import algorithms, foo')

# Output the time it took in micro seconds
print("Time: " + str(time) + " micro sec")


## Insertion sort ##

# Output sorted
foo = numList
print("Sorted with insertion sort" + str(algorithms.insertionSort(foo)))

# Time the sorting with timeit.timeit
time = timeit.timeit('algorithms.insertionSort(foo)',
                     'from __main__ import algorithms, foo')

# Output the time it took in micro seconds
print("Time: " + str(time) + " micro sec")

## Selection sort ##

# Output sorted
foo = numList
print("Sorted with selection sort" + str(algorithms.selectionSort(foo)))

# Time the sorting with timeit.timeit
time = timeit.timeit('algorithms.selectionSort(foo)',
                     'from __main__ import algorithms, foo')

# Output the time it took in micro seconds
print("Time: " + str(time) + " micro sec")


## Merge sort ##

# Output sorted
foo = numList
print("Sorted with merge sort" + str(algorithms.mergeSort(foo.copy())))

# Time the sorting with timeit.timeit
time = timeit.timeit('algorithms.selectionSort(foo)',
                     'from __main__ import algorithms, foo')

# Output the time it took in micro seconds
print("Time: " + str(time) + " micro sec")
